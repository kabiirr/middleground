 * one wide gap at the loop's join — the one place the grid's gutter would not
 * hold. And they have to finish level at every width, which takes more than
 * matching totals: a height is so many gutters, which never change, plus so
 * much artwork, which grows with the screen. Two columns stay level only if
 * they match on both. So the four columns of work carry seven pieces each in
 * the same proportions — five in 4:5 and two square.
 *
 * The middle column is the exception twice over: it is wider than the others,
 * and the studio's name is the seventh thing in it rather than a piece of work.
 * The name's height is whatever the other six leave, worked out below rather
 * than set by hand — which is what lets this column hold pieces of any shape,
 * and why the two that match nothing else stand here.
 *

 * in a row down a column, and the squares spaced through the portraits rather
 * than gathered.
